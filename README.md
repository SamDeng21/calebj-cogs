This repo contains cogs I've written, as well as those I've modified and republished when a PR was either unwanted or too drastic of a change from the original cog's scope.

## Installation
Type the following commands into any channel your bot can see, or in a direct message to it.

**1. Adding the repo** - replace `[p]` with your bot's prefix:
```
[p]repo add calebj-cogs https://github.com/calebj/calebj-cogs v3/master
```

**2. Installing a cog** - replace `[COG_NAME]` with the name of the cog you want:
```
[p]cog install calebj-cogs [COG_NAME]
```

## Support and Contact
If you have questions or need support for any of my cogs, please ask in my [Red Cog support server](https://discord.gg/2DacSZ7) channel (#support_calebj). I may ask you to open a GitHub issue in this repo if your fix or request isn't a quick one.

If you want to contact me directly, I am **@calebj#0001** on Discord, and my email is **me@calebj.io**.

If my cogs have made your life easier, consider supporting me through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/calebrj) or [becoming a patron](https://www.patreon.com/calebj). I also take cog commissions, which can either be public (added to this repo) or private (only for you).

## Contributing
Please submit patches to code or documentation as GitHub pull requests!

Contributions must be licensed under the GNU GPLv3 or compatible license. The contributor retains the copyright. I won't accept new cogs unless I want to support them.

## Usage Statistics and Privacy Policy
To help get a better idea of how my cogs are used, I wrote a module to collect and send me data about which cogs are loaded, which commands are run, and some other cog-specific parameters. This module can be enabled, disabled, and un/loaded like any other cog. Loading it is considered explicitly "opting in".

I use [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) on my webserver to record events, and don't share the data with anyone else. All user IDs are hashed before sending to make them unique without being able to identify the users (or bots) in question, and IP addresses are stripped. Only "Pseudonymous Data" is collected or stored, and since none of it is for commercial use, I am not obligated to respond to GDPR requests. More information can be found in my [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md).
